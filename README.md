# Algorithms
* LeaderRank: An up-to-date PageRank-like bibliometric method which can evaluate researchers quantitatively in a specific research field by both cooperation and citation rates, invented by Li et al.(2014) and improved by Deng et al.(2015). In our study, the parameter Wig was changed to mean(sum(Wij)) to make the result robust.
* DOM Parser: A simple HTML DOM parser written in PHP5+ by john_schlick and me578022 which can parse HTML or XML files into text data, source code can be found at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplehtmldom/.
* Duplicate Name Detection: An algorithm
